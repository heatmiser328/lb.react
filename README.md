# lb.react
Well, it's about as full featured as the others versions, but it still isn't quite right.

The fully native android version is still the best (java and the adk). This react native version comes in second (and not a bit behind). The tabrisjs version is well behind the react version. Overall, the foray into multi-platform development hasn't gone as well as was hoped...
